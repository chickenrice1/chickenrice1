yeah so im still getting back into the tie of coding, its been a while. before i took this code hibernation, i was atcualy pretty good at it. using github is still pretty new to me, even after using it for 4 years, over the span of 5 different accounts. I can't make games or legit programs, but  can make little websites! they arent very good, but i can make chickenrice cafe menu sometime in feburary. pretty soon, i will be working on a proxy hosted off a raspberry-pi {eta: 6 years} after getting familiar with raspberry and getting an atcual job. Im a part-time skiier (mostly winter skiier) and can do some pretty cool things. I like to go to White Pass ski resort, even though the drive makes me age 120 years. I dont snowboard much, but I kinda enjoy it. More skiier though. Im also a pretty big ports person, I love running, biking, and snow sports. I crash real hard skiing and biking, and slip into mud whie running. I pretty good at al of them, trying to keep this as short as possible, im pretty athletic. visit my site <a href="https://sites.google.com/ksd.org/chickenrice/home" alt="here">here!</a>

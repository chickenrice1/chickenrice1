yeah so im still getting back into the tie of coding, for its been a while. before i took this code hibernation, i was atcualy pretty good at it. using github is still pretty new to me, even after using it for 4 years, over the span of 5 different accounts. I can't make games or legit programs, but  can make little websites! they arent very good, but i can make chickenrice cafe menu sometime in feburary. pretty soon, i will be working on a proxy hosted off a raspberry-pi {eta: 6 years} after getting familiar with raspberry and getting an atcual job. visit my site <a href="https://sites.google.com/ksd.org/chickenrice/home" alt="here">here!</a>

## licenses
all of my work is handled under the MIT license and the CC BY-NC-ND (Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives), but just credit me and don't modify my work if its under the CC BY-NC-ND license. If under the MIT license, do whatever, provided that the original license and copyright notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. If under WTFPL (do what the <em>fck</em> you want public license), do whatever the <em>fck</em> you want with it. modify, use for commercial, burn it, sell it, show your friends your "awesome coding capabilities" and dont credit me, i dont care. thats why the license is there. 
Typically I would add a license just to clerify what people can do with whatever. All of my projects are upublic, but they will typiclly be held under the MIT and CC BY-NC-ND licenses. 

## pull requests
if you want to make a pull request to add, change, or remove code in any repository or folder, please describe so in the descrition. Faliure to do so will cause me to skip by it until further information is given. It also depends on what change ou are willing to make. I will also look at your profile to see if I can trust you with this change.

## contact me
please dont contact me about marketing, money, or advertising me or a product. Im mostly free-lance, relying on people to tell me to make something they want then them paying me for it. generally, dont contect me though. Unless you need help with coding [html + js], i just wont talk to you. no calls either.

## proxies and web blockers
if there is a repository that is a proxy or web blocker, <strong> please, please, please</strong> dont yell at me about it. it is most likely a fork from someone else that i thought was cool and added. if it doesnt work, dont yell at me. see who is was forked by, then yell at them. web blockers, more specifically ad blockers and vpn, probably wont work, since I have no way to test them. if they do work however, send me an email and a link to it and I will label it as working. if it doesnt work, then I will label it as
<strong>[WORKING-tested}</strong>. it will <em>mostly</em> be for me, just so i dont accidentally change the code or delete it or aything.

## disclamers
if something does not work, PLEASE do not spam me telling me that it doesnt work, just make an issue and mark it as not working. I tend to get to those faster than other tags.

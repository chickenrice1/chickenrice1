yeah so im still getting back into the tie of coding, its been a while. before i took this code hibernation, i was atcualy pretty good at it. using github is still pretty new to me, even after using it for 4 years, over the span of 5 different accounts. I can't make games or legit programs, but  can make little websites! they arent very good, but i can make chickenrice cafe menu pretty soon! this is me :D!(https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7af3c00-238b-4689-bbe2-349fabb20a34)
